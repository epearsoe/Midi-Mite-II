# Midi-Mite-II

This is a clone of the original Midi-Mite by bonafide systems which has become a rather rare ADAM device to find. My thanks to Rich Dirocco for supplying
an original Midi-Mite for this project. The current prototype board design is untested at this point so as always use at your own risk.
